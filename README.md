# Multi-omics profiling of human endothelial differentiation
Investigating the dynamic cis-gene regulation throughout vascular EC differentiation

## Summary
The epigenomic remodeling and the pathological dysfunctions involved in vascular endothelial cell (EC) formation and differentiation are largely unknown. Here, we construct extensive gene regulatory landscapes for human EC differentiation, sectioned at highly dense time points. This led to the identification of 42,309 differentiation stage-specific cis-regulatory elements (cREs) during human-EC differentiation, which uncovers potential upstream regulators involved in EC lineage specification. Our heritability analysis shows that cREs transiently activated during EC differentiation harbor a significant amount of germline genetic variants related to vasculature-related dysfunctions, specifically colorectal cancer (CRC). Further, we accurately pin-down functional targets of these noncoding risk variants using high-resolution 3D chromatin contact maps. By leveraging single-cell transcriptome from CRC tumors, strikingly, we reveal that late-stage specific cis-regulome and their putative target genes may mediate reactivation of vascular ECs to form tumor-associated ECs (TECs), via angiogenic factors such as APLN, NRP2, SH3BGL3, and TP53I11. Overall, the transcriptome and epigenome maps provide the foundation for illuminating stage-specific gene regulation in vascular EC formation and their pathological associations.
